# lens-protocol-dapp (WIP)

## Prerequisites
1. Install Hardhat `https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview`
2. Install Docker `https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/`
## Getting Started
1. First you will need to go ahead and install the lens protocol locally. To do so head over to the following url and follow the instructions there `https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/quick-setup`


## Running Dapp
1. First run `nvm use` in your terminal. If you don't have nvm set up you will need to set it up. This is one way of doing so `https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/`
2. Next you will want to run `yarn install` to get all of the necessary dependencies.

# Sample Hardhat Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Solidity import errors... will need to config vscode environment for where to look
